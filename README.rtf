Linker Lab NYU CAS Operating Systems Fall 2019
The lab scored 99/100. 

This is my Two Pass Linker lab solution in C. To run from the terminal do the following:

Compile: 
gcc linker.c
\
Run with the input file you want to check by typing the following command:\
 ./a.out < inputfilename
 
OR if you want to type the input from the keyboard type:

 ./a.out 

and then type the input

TADA! The output will be printed }
